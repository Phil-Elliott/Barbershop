# Barbershop

This was a pretty fun project and I learned quite a bit. It was my first website, so a lot of mistakes were made in the process and alot of those became more noticable at the end. 

Things I learned
  1) Media queries 
  2) Using Javascript to improve the nav bar
  3) Using Javascript to blur imgs 

Things I need to learn more about 
  1) Improving CSS (My CSS looks really messy) 
          - I will definitely have to go back in, write notes, and clean it up. 
  2) How to structure a website to make it more responsive by the end of the project.
          - I had to write a lot of CSS to make this responsive. I'm not too sure how normal that is.

Time
  - This took me a total of 3 days and I averaged around 5hrs a day, so I will say it took me around a total of 15hrs.
